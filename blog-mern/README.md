## Run

To run this application (the master branch), You have to run the client and server together. First you have to clone the frontend part repository via this link [MERN-blog-frontend](https://github.com/goodelias/goodelias.github.io/tree/master/mern-blog-frontend). Since you have both parts of the project we can start set everything up to run the app.

**Backend**

Open the server part of the project and set your own environmental variables in the server root folder. For security reasons, some variables have been hidden from view and used as environmental variables with the help of dotenv package. Below are the variables that you need to set in order to run the server:

- MONGO_URI: this is the connection string of your MongoDB Atlas database.

- SECRET_KEY: you can provide any string here, it is used to encrypt the JWT authentication token.

- PORT: provide any port you want this application to run on

After you've set these environmental variables in the .env file at the root of the server folder, run "node index.js" to run the server.

**Frontend**

Open frontend part and run in the console "npm init" to set up an existing npm package. Then run "npm start" to start the client.

And now the application should start.
